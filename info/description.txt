LibAddonMenu is a library which offers many functions for add-on authors to simplify creating a configuration panel in the game's settings menu.

If the game cannot load some addon because it is missing LibAddonMenu-2.0 as a dependency, simply download and install it like you would any other addon. In case it shows as "out of date" in the game, simply enable the "allow out of date addons" checkbox.

[SIZE="5"]In case you get an error that contains text like this:
[COLOR="Cyan"]user:/AddOns/[COLOR="DarkOrange"][B]<some other addon>[/B][/COLOR]/Libs/LibAddonMenu-2.0[/COLOR]

Some other addon you have installed likely contains an old version of LibAddonMenu which is loaded before the most current one.

Make sure to [U]search for LibAddonMenu-2.0 folders[/U] in your AddOns folder and [U]delete all of them[/U]. Afterwards install the latest version of LibAddonMenu-2.0 separately.

Ever since I (sirinsidiator) have taken over development of LAM-2.0 in 2015, the project is available on [URL=https://github.com/sirinsidiator/ESO-LibAddonMenu]github[/URL] and open for contributions by other authors.

With the ongoing effort to get rid of LibStub in favour of the library management capabilities provided by the game itself since Summerset was released, it is no longer recommended to embed LAM, or use LibStub to access it. Instead it should simply be specified as a dependency and accessed via the new LibAddonMenu2 global variable. Instead of providing it as part of another add-on, users should install and update it separately. 

[SIZE="3"]Quickstart:[/SIZE]
Simply add LAM2 as a dependency in your addon manifest:
[CODE]## DependsOn: LibAddonMenu-2.0[/CODE]
Optionally you can require a specific minimum version of LAM in case you rely on some features that are not available in earlier versions.
[CODE]## DependsOn: LibAddonMenu-2.0>=30[/CODE]

In your code you can simply access the library via the global variable "LibAddonMenu2" and start creating your settings panel and controls:

[highlight="Lua"]local LAM = LibAddonMenu2
local saveData = {} -- TODO this should be a reference to your actual saved variables table
local panelName = "MyAddOnSettingsPanel" -- TODO the name will be used to create a global variable, pick something unique or you may overwrite an existing variable!

local panelData = {
    type = "panel",
    name = "MyAddOn Settings",
    author = "me",
}
local panel = LAM:RegisterAddonPanel(panelName, panelData)
local optionsData = {
    {
        type = "checkbox",
        name = "My First Checkbox",
        getFunc = function() return saveData.myValue end,
        setFunc = function(value) saveData.myValue = value end
    }
}
LAM:RegisterOptionControls(panelName, optionsData)[/highlight]
