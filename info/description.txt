Since I (sirinsidiator) have taken over development of LAM-2.0 I decided it will be in the best interest of everyone to make future development a group effort.
With the consent of Seerah I have put LAM-2.0 under [URL=https://github.com/sirinsidiator/ESO-LibAddonMenu/blob/master/LICENSE]The Artistic License 2.0[/URL] and created a [URL=https://github.com/sirinsidiator/ESO-LibAddonMenu]github project[/URL] in order to make collaborations possible.
I also want to thank everyone who participated in planning and realizing upcoming changes, especially votan, merlight and Garkin.

[B][SIZE="3"]If you came here because a message in chat told you so,[/SIZE][/B]  
then you are using an outdated addon that relies on an older version of LAM-2.0 which might not be compatible with ESO update 6. 
But no need to panic. There are a few things you can do in order to get it to work again:
[LIST=1]
[*]Update your addons. Maybe the author already fixed the problem.
[*]Try to find out which addon uses the outdated version and ask for help in the comment section.
[*]Ask for help in our comment section.
[*]Replace LibAddonMenu-2.0 in all your addons with the newest version.
[/LIST]

LibAddonMenu-2.0 is now released!
Your addons will continue to work under LAM-1.0, however that version of the library will no longer be receiving updates, and you will not receive any benefits of LAM-2.0.

[COLOR="Wheat"][B]** NOTE:[/B] If you are using a version of LAM-2.0 earlier than r17, please update your copy of the lib in the addon. This will avoid problems with loading future versions of LAM.[B]**[/B][/COLOR]


LibAddonMenu-2.0 is a library to aid addon authors in creating a configuration GUI for their addons which is located in the game's Settings menu.  It supports the ability to have all of a user's addon options located in the same panel.

You may see [URL="http://www.esoui.com/downloads/info6-ZAMStats.html"]ZAM_Stats[/URL] for an example of usage.


[SIZE="3"][U][COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]HOW TO USE:[/COLOR][/U][/SIZE]

[COLOR="Plum"]--Including the library with your addon--[/COLOR]
You may either embed the library and LibStub in your addon and load the files from your addon manifest, or have the library installed like any other normal addon.

If your addon embeds the library, you may place this line in your manifest file, just in case the user also has a standalone version installed.
[CODE]## OptionalDependsOn: LibAddonMenu-2.0[/CODE]

If you are depending on the library being installed separately and are not embedding it, then you must include this line in your text file.
[CODE]## DependsOn: LibAddonMenu-2.0[/CODE]

Either way you choose, LibStub will ensure that only one copy of the library (the newest revision) is loaded into memory.

When embedding the libary, remove the internal LibAddonMenu-2.0 folder from the main library download.  I usually place my libraries in a sub-folder called "libs", but you may put them wherever you like in your addon directory.  This is how I would then list the files in my manifest.  (LAM2's widget controls are broken out into their own files to keep their code clean - this is why there is so many.  Good thing you only have to copy-paste this once!)
